## Project title
Idea Box: note cards
Created by Jessica Hansen (https://github.com/jessicalyn), Mariel Waters (https://github.com/MarielWaters), & Justin Pyktel (https://github.com/SiimonStark)

## Motivation
Our Second group project, where our Javascript skills were put to the test!! We had to learn a lot of the code either on our own or we had to ask for tips and assistance from our peers with more experience. I would say that the experience we gained in completing this project has certainly given us a much more thorough understand of using LocalStorage Javascrcipt concepts (such as: creating an array of new instances, and then pulling, changing, and updating that content).

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript</b>

## Features
If you have an idea, keep track of it on this handy little site.
-It'll save to your localStorage, so even if you refresh the page it will still be there.
-Think your idea is "Genius"!? Upvote the quality to genius.
-Want to find that one genius idea among your stack of note cards? Use our search feature to find the card by title or by whats in the body
-Want to look at only your "Genius Ideas"? Use our filter by quality feauture to view only the quality that you want.

## Challenges/Wins
Many challenges!!: Diving right into javascript was a headache, but felt the most rewarding once things started to click and our understanding of the overall concepts started to come to light.

Biggest win: Learning the ins and outs of using localStorage.

Challenges and places for improvement:
- becoming more efficient with LocalStorage
